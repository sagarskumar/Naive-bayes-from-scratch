# Naive-bayes-from-scratch

In this blog post, we're going to build a spam filter using Python and the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. Our goal is to code a spam filter from scratch that classifies messages with an accuracy greater than 80%.

I used dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/gautamsundar/sms-spam-collection-dataset/data

We're going to focus on the Python implementation throughout the post

The multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm will need to answer these two probability questions to be able to classify new messages:

AS I implemented the algorithm on this dataset my accuracy was as follows :
